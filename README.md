# HTML Linker

It's essentially the concept of a linker for object files into one static self-contained executable, but for HTML. See the [master branch](https://github.com/minefreak19/html-linker/blob/master) for info on the original implementation, though the project is currently undergoing a rewrite because the original implementation was pretty f~cking terrible.

## Notes
This project uses [tsoding's String_View library](https://github.com/tsoding/sv).
